/**
 * A C5Module is the common interface for all modules in a C5 server.
 * A server consists of a number of {@link c5db.interfaces.C5Module}s running within
 * a JVM.  Each module has a lifecycle (eg: starting, started, failed, etc).  The only
 * way in which modules may interact with each other is via the public module interface
 * which must be inside the {@link c5db.interfaces} package.
 * <p>
 * To handle the module's lifecycle, it implements the guava {@link com.google.common.util.concurrent.Service}
 * interface.  Individual implementations would be encouraged to use guava's
 * {@link com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractService}.
 * <p>
 * Other features that we need to support in the future (that arent explicit here right now)
 * <ul>
 * <li>Module startup-dependencies (eg: module A needs module B to be running)</li>
 * <li>Module startup configuration (eg: what port should this module bind to?)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
