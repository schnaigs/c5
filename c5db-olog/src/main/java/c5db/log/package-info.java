/**
 * This package handles write-ahead logging for the C5 database. It provides and implements the
 * {@link c5db.log.OLog} abstraction, which allows logging for several different quorums (each
 * one representing the actions of a different region) potentially all interspersed within the same
 * log file on disk. It also provides an interface to that shared WAL for quorum-specific replicators
 * to use, so that conceptually each has its own WAL. And, it provides compatibility with
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.wal.HLog} in the form of {@link c5db.log.OLogShim}.
