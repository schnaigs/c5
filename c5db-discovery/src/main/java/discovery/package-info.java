package discovery;
/**
 The discovery module is responsible for discovering peers in the cluster. It also
 provides the mapping from node/peer id to physical network address (IP/IPv6).
 <p>
 The discovery module can accomplish it's job via multiple methods.
 These might be:
 <ul>
 <li>UDP broadcast/multicast</li>
 <li>DNS discovery</li>
 <li>static configuration file</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 Currently only UDP discovery is implemented.  This is embodied in the
 {@link c5db.discovery.BeaconService} class.  This class implements the
 {@link c5db.interfaces.DiscoveryModule} interface - but in the future it probably
 shouldn't.
 <p>
 Future work includes:
 <ul>
 <li>Detecting the last time a node was reachable.</li>
 <li>Taking availability reports from other modules (most likely the
 {@link c5db.interfaces.ReplicationModule}</li>
 <li>Something else?</li>
 </ul>
