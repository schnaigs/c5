/**
 * This package contains functionality for replicating write-ahead logs. "Replication" here means functionally
 * duplicating the information in the log, in general on several different durable media hosted by different
 * machines. The purposes of replication are fault tolerance and availability.
 * <p>
 * The package contains an implementation of the {@link c5db.interfaces.ReplicationModule} interface:
 * ReplicatorService. A given ReplicatorService instance participates in the replication of one or more
 * different regions' write-ahead logs. Likewise, a given region's logs are replicated across one or more
 * different ReplicatorService instances; the set of participating replicators for that region is known
 * as a quorum.
 * <p>
 * ReplicatorService keeps a separate instance of the implementation of the
 * {@link c5db.interfaces.replication.Replicator} interface for each quorum it participates in.
 * <p>
 * Each such implementation (e.g. ReplicatorInstance) is in charge of the logic and state for the replication
 * of that quorum, and that logic and state is separate from that of any other quorum supported by the same
 * ReplicatorService.
